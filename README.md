# VTU-Analytics
A undergrade publication and research on results of millions of students studying various courses and stream under VTU.

## Abstract

> Our research work and analytics project “VTU ANALYTICS” aims at creating a web portal which will automate the processes over each student’s result via very intricate and derived algorithms. Using this it is possible to keep a track on the result of each and every existing students studying in any non-autonomous colleges affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University. It also aims to provide statistical analytics,  data science aspects, visual analysis on the student’s performance over the various semesters.

> This web portal uses PHP as the core language for result analytics. phpMyAdmin is backend administrative tool which is used for database administration. It provides interactive GUI to the developer along with a number of built in controls for handling and manipulating database. Since in database manipulation, interaction between end-user and system component is mandatory, jQuery is used as a cross-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. 

> VTU ANALYTICS provides an in-depth analysis (graphical, statistical) of the student performance studying in Karnataka, India region.
